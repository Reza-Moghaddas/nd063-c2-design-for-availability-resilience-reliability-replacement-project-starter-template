According to the course exercise,
the RTO for a single-region/single-AZ outage would be :
00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
00:41 - Root cause is discovered (15 minutes)
00:46 - Remediation started (5 minutes)
00:56 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)

The RTO for a single-Region/Multi-AZ outage would be:
00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
00:11 - On-call staff recover the backup or switch to anothe AZ and start redemption on main (5 minutes)

The RPO for a single region/single AZ outage would be equal to the time difference between the last backup
and the time when the disaster happened.

The RPO for a single region as RDS uploads transaction logs for DB instance to S3 every 5 minutes, the minimum RPO
depends on value of the LatestRestorableTime field for the DB instance.
